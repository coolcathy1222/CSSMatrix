CSSMatrix
=========

A WebkitCSSMatrix and MSCSSMatrix polyfill for older browsers and browsers (specifically Firefox and Opera) without current support for this feature.

The CSSMatrix objects represent a 4x4 homogeneous matrix for 3D transforms. The development target is to mirror the functionality provided by the native WebkitCSSMatrix object.

As this is a personal project I made in order to fix a few problems with a website I'm building, I haven't devoted much time to it yet, so it's probably still a few commits behind becoming a fully working polyfill. However, most of the functionality is already there, so if anyone wants to fork this and implement some of the functions that haven't been written yet, I'd be very happy to see that.
